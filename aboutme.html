    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>I'm looking forward to continuing my education in college after highschool. I hope to pursue a a career that helps me learn more about myself and just more about the world. Career paths I've been interested are forensics' science or dentistry. Experiences that have led me to where i am now is taking my time to know what i want in my life and what i don't and taking the right paths to have good people to help me through everything I've been through or had to face in times where it was too much to do on my own I'm grateful for everything bad and good that has happened to me because it led me to the best version of myself. Working toward these goals i remind myself not to lose control and focus and not get too stressed out and make sure i have time t0o complete i need to do before deadlines. My values are who make me who i am without them i don't know where i would be i know right from wrong and I'm so thankful for knowing my heart will always let me choose the good in any situation i know what needs to be done. Short-term goals I'm hoping to accomplish soon are getting good grades in my classes. Finishing my college application's and making sure im ready for the next step in my life. Graduating highschool in genera; and having a good last track field season ever. The character traits i want to be known is my good intentions toward everyone and making my best effort in everything i try even if I'm not always the best. I have always believed that the people you surround yourself with is what makes you person who you really are and im happy to say that i believe the people i surround myself with are the best people I've ever know and wouldn't be no where near how happy i am today without them.
